        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p class="text">
            Hello and welcome to my page, my name is Oghor. I am training to be a cloud engineer. I joined AltSchool because of the great reviews about how hands on they are and how exhaustive the curriculum is. My altschool ID is 1234HYUI. I enjoy travelling and adventure, discovering new places and food. I read a lot of fiction as well as non-fiction as well.

        <h2>My goals for school of engineering</h2>
        <p class="text">My goal is to graduate as a skilled cloud engineer proficient in AWS, GCP, and Azure.</p>
        <P class="text">Starting my journey at AltSchool, my primary goal is to become a skilled cloud engineer. I am at the beginning of this path, and I’m excited about the opportunities to learn and grow in this field. Cloud engineering is a dynamic and rapidly evolving area, and I’m eager to dive into the core concepts and tools that define this career. I want to gain a deep understanding of cloud computing fundamentals, including infrastructure, networking, and security.<br><br>

        Throughout my time at AltSchool, I plan to immerse myself in learning about cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. I want to master the deployment and management of cloud resources, understanding the nuances of scaling, load balancing, and automation. My goal is to become proficient in managing cloud environments, ensuring they are efficient, secure, and resilient.<br><br>

        I’m also keen on exploring the intricacies of DevOps, learning how continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines integrate with cloud services. This knowledge will be essential as I strive to streamline operations and improve the reliability of cloud-based applications.<br><br>

        As I progress, I hope to gain practical experience through hands-on projects, where I can apply what I’ve learned to real-world scenarios. My journey at AltSchool is just beginning, but I’m determined to build a strong foundation in cloud engineering and eventually become an expert in the field.</P>
